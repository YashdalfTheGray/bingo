# Javascript's RNG

I'll caveat this whole document with, "someone's probably already done this but I wanted to do it myself".

## The hypothesis

Javascript's RNG generates numbers on a flat probability curve. Meaning, if we are trying to generate 100 numbers in the range of 1 through 15 inclusive, the numbers will generate with an equal distribution.
